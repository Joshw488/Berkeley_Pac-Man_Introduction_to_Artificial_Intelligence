# Berkeley_Pac-Man_Introduction_to_Artificial_Intelligence

This project includes three parts of Berkeley's Pac-Man project for an introduction to artificial intelligence. 

Part one is search, this explores different search algorithms to help Pac-Man find an exit. The search algorithms include depth-first, breadth-first, greedy, uniform cost and A* search.

Part two is multiagent, this explores different zero-sum algorithms such as minimax and expectimax to predict opponents behavior as well as various evaluation functions. 

Part three is reinforcement learning, this part uses model-based q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms to enable Pac-Man to learn from experience and eventually find the optimal path.
